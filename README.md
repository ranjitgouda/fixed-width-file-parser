# Data Engineering Coding Challenges

## Judgment Criteria

- Beauty of the code (beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder)
- Testing strategies
- Basic Engineering principles

## Problem 1

### Parse fixed width file

- Generate a fixed width file using the provided spec (offset provided in the spec file represent the length of each field).
- Implement a parser that can parse the fixed width file and generate a delimited file, like CSV for example.
- DO NOT use python libraries like pandas for parsing. You can use the standard library to write out a csv file (If you feel like)
- Language choices (Python or Scala)
- Deliver source via github or bitbucket
- Bonus points if you deliver a docker container (Dockerfile) that can be used to run the code (too lazy to install stuff that you might use)
- Pay attention to encoding

## Usage
- execute the run.sh script
- usage ./run.sh <no of lines in file required>  
- The code reads the spec file and creates a fixed width file matching with the offset of the fields.
- The code reads the fixed width file creates and then uses the offset from spec to generate a csv file.
